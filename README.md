# Stopwatch
A JavaScript powered Stopwatch

This Stopwatch works the same way our traditional stopwatch works and it is very easy to use.
You can start using it by pressing the "Start" button and you can also pause, resume and reset the time as you want it by pressing the "Pause", "Resume" and "Reset" buttons.
NOTE: 1000 Milliseconds make 1 Second, 60 Seconds make 1 Minute while 60 Minutes make 1 Hour.
